## Winterbells - a Tribute to Adobe Flash

Welcome to my game project as part of SEI-30. You can view my pre-project work **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FPpK08GfnCg-nzXYBe4s_IeFqKawccZENnjvBIqs-nE/edit?usp=sharing)**.

### Winterbells is a classic from my childhood Adobe Flash games era. Credit to Ferry Halim & Orisinal Games.

> Simple mechanics, a soothing snow-filled backdrop, and a personal challenge to beat your previous high score. What's not to like?
